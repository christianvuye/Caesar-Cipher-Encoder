# Caesar-Cipher-Encoder

- **Description:** This project is a small desktop application I built to encode messages with the Caesar Cipher. 

- **Features:** This small application allows for messages that contain letters, spaces and symbols (..,?'!) to be encoded with the Ceasar Cipher, using an integer offset. 

- **How to use**: If you are on a Linux platform, you can simply run the executable. If you are on Mac or Windows, you can either run the Python script from an IDE debugger such as Visual Studio Code, or build an executable from the script. There are limitations to the encoding application though, as there is no check in place yet to make sure the user inputs only letters, spaces and/or symbols. Nor is there a check in place yet which checks whether the user provides a whole number for encoding the message. These checks will be put in place in a future version of the application. 

- **Technologies:** 
	+ Python
	+ tkinter

- **Collaborators:** This project was originally a part of the Codecademy Python 3 Fundamentals course. I expanded upon the original project, added a user interface and created an executable for Linux platforms.
